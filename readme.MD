## Description

The Virtual Piano Keyboard it's a project developed in my first Hackathon, during my Full Stack Bootcamp on Developers Institute.

It was a very challenging project. I was able to adventure myself for the first time with technologies as SASS and it was a very good way to see how we can use it to be more productive in the style part of the product.

Since it was my first Hackathon right after a lot of DOM content, I had the idea to go through all the concepts I've been seen in the last weeks and try to apply of all them into this project, going even deeper, trying to find good solutions connecting .WAV sounds to each one of the respective piano keys on the screen, for instance.

The idea was to implement all the knowledge acquired in my Bootcamp, not only about DOM, and try to figure out how to develop a nice and functional Piano simulator.
